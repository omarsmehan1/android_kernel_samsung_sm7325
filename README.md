✨ Overview

NovaKernel is a custom GKI kernel based on the Rio kernel, developed specifically for Samsung SM7325 devices running OneUI.

The project focuses on a clean and reliable kernel base, while carefully integrating KernelSU and SUSFS to provide modern root capabilities with advanced concealment — without breaking stock behavior or stability.

NovaKernel is not about bloated features; it is about doing a few things right.

⚠️ Important Notice

🚨 OneUI Recommended

> [!WARNING] NovaKernel is primarily developed and tested for Samsung OneUI ROMs.

⚠️ AOSP-based ROMs (LineageOS, Pixel Experience, GSIs, etc.) may boot, but they are NOT officially supported.

❌ Using NovaKernel on AOSP ROMs is not recommended due to potential instability, missing features, or unexpected behavior.

✅ For best stability, compatibility, and support — OneUI is strongly recommended.**
