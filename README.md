NovaKernel 🚀

   

Welcome to the official repository for NovaKernel.

NovaKernel is a custom GKI kernel based on the Rio kernel, built for the Samsung SM7325 platform. The main goal of this project is to provide a clean, stable kernel foundation while integrating KernelSU and SUSFS for modern root management and advanced root concealment.

The focus is on stability, upstream security patches, and keeping the kernel close to stock behavior, with carefully added features that matter.

⚡ Features

NovaKernel focuses on essential improvements without unnecessary changes:

Rio Kernel Base:

Built on top of the Rio kernel source.

Keeps Samsung OneUI behavior and compatibility intact.


Linux Upstream:

Kernel version updated to 5.4.302.

(Stock Samsung kernel remains on 5.4.289).

Includes newer security patches and stability fixes.


Root & Privacy Enhancements:

KernelSU: Kernel-level root solution with minimal overhead.

SUSFS: Advanced kernel-based hiding for root and system modifications.



📱 Supported Devices

This kernel targets the SM7325 platform and is intended for:

Samsung Galaxy A73 5G (SM-A736B)

Samsung Galaxy A52s 5G (SM-A528B)

Samsung Galaxy M52 5G (SM-M526B)
